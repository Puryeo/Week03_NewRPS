New_Rock_Paper_Scissors ? Tag-based Joker System To-Do List (Step-by-Step)

Purpose
- Implement a data-driven, tag-based Joker system per PRD section L, with small, testable steps.
- Keep turnsToPlay independent from hand sizes; end round early if a side runs out of cards.
- Include Unity editor instructions so non-engineers can follow along.

Ground Rules
- Do not implement all features at once. Complete each step, then test in Play Mode.
- Keep GameManager working at every step (no breaking changes).
- Commit after each green Play test.

Codebase Audit (Scripts folder)
- Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs
  - Status: DONE. Uses tag pipeline (GameContext + ExecuteTurnSettlementEffects).
- Assets/Scripts/DEBUGHUD.cs
  - Status: DONE. Asset-based toggles; shows CurrentText/PipelineText; calls OnJokerToggled.
- Assets/Scripts/Jokers/JokerManager.cs
  - Status: DONE. Tag interpreter/executor; RoundStart + TurnSettlement; AIDrawFromFront per round; validation logs; unified RPSLog events.
- Assets/Scripts/Jokers/IJoker.cs
  - Status: REMOVED (legacy cleanup).
- Assets/Scripts/Jokers/JokerTypes.cs
  - Status: REMOVED (legacy cleanup).
- Assets/Scripts/Jokers/AllInRockJoker.cs, ContrarianJoker.cs, ScoutJoker.cs
  - Status: REMOVED (legacy cleanup).

Archetypes
- Flags: Anchor, Payoff, Catalyst, Utility, Risk (JokerData.archetypes)

Folder Plan (created)
- Assets/Scripts/Jokers/Data
- Assets/Scripts/Jokers/Runtime
- Assets/JokerAssets (ScriptableObjects live here)
- Assets/Scripts/Jokers/Legacy (not used; legacy removed)

Step 0. Scene and basic setup
- DONE

Step 1. Data model skeleton (no logic yet)
- DONE (JokerData, JokerTag, JokerEnums, GameContext)

Step 2. Refactor JokerManager to tag-based skeleton
- DONE

Step 3. Minimal integration sanity check
- DONE (OnRoundStart wired)

Step 4. Tag schema v1 + timing pipeline
- DONE (Timing/Condition/Effect; AddScoreDelta, ForceAIDrawFromFront, ShowInfo)

Step 5. Create sample JokerData assets (expressed via tags)
- TODO (authoring in Unity Editor)
  - All_In_Rock
  - The_Contrarian
  - Scout

Step 6. Refactor DEBUGHUD to asset-based toggles
- DONE

Step 7. Switch score pipeline in GameManager to tags
- DONE

Step 8. Scout info and draw policy via tags
- DONE (RoundStart apply draw policy; ShowInfo uses PeekAIFront/PeekAIBack)

Step 9. Tag extension and safety
- DONE (validation warnings and safe fallbacks)

Step 9.1. Round history & meta conditions
- DONE (GameContext turnIndex/turnsPlanned/isLastTurn; playerHistory/outcomeHistory)
- DONE Conditions: PlayedAtLeastCount, ConsecutiveDrawWithChoiceIs, IsLastTurn
- DONE Effect: FinalScoreMultiplier (applies immediately when conditions met)

Step 10. QA checklist (run each time)
- TODO (manual test per PRD section J)

Step 11. Cleanup ? remove legacy IJoker-based system
- DONE (files deleted; references removed)

Step 12. Spawn system (draft)
- TODO Add JokerSpawnWeights ScriptableObject
  - per-archetype weights (Anchor/Payoff/Catalyst/Utility/Risk)
  - optional per-joker overrides list
- TODO Add JokerSpawnManager
  - API: GetRandomJoker(IEnumerable<JokerData> pool, JokerSpawnWeights weights)
  - Filters by archetype mask; applies weights; returns a pick
  - Deterministic with seed(optional)

Definition of Done
- Designers can create new jokers via assets without code changes for existing tags. (YES)
- System tolerates unknown tags with warnings. (YES)
- Legacy IJoker classes/enums removed; JokerManager fully tag/data-driven. (YES)
- PRD updated and in sync with implementation. (YES)
- Spawn system spec captured (weights SO + manager draft). (PENDING)
